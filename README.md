# MPLNClust

## Description
For clustering count data, specifically clustering of count data arising from RNA sequencing studies. The vector of normalization factors can be relaxed and clustering method may be applied to other types of count data. 

Main function *mpln* carries out model-based clustering using mixtures of multivariate Poisson-log normal (MPLN) model. Markov chain Monte Carlo expectation-maximization algorithm (MCMC-EM) is used for parameter estimation. Information criteria (AIC, BIC, AIC3 and ICL) and slope heuristics (Djump and DDSE) are offered for model selection. See example below for more details.

```

## Overview

``` r

```

This package contains 3 functions for the purpose of generating simlulation data via MPLN, carrying out clustering of count data using MPLN and for visualizing clustered data. 


## Details

Output of main_mpln() is an S3 object of class MPLN. 

The multivariate Poisson-log normal (MPLN; Aitchison and Ho, 1989) distribution is a multivariate log normal mixture of independent Poisson distributions. The hidden layer of the MPLN distribution is a multivariate Gaussian distribution, which allows for the specification of a covariance structure. Further, the MPLN distribution can account for overdispersion in count data. 

A mixture of MPLN distributions is introduced for clustering count data from RNA sequencing using the approach of [Silva et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.11190v1). The MCMC-EM algorithm via Stan is used for parameter estimation. Coarse grain parallelization is employed, such that when a range of components/clusters (G) are considered, each G is run on a different processor. To check the convergence of MCMC chains, the potential scale reduction factor and the effective number of samples are used. The Heidelberger and Welchâ€™s convergence diagnostic (Heidelberger and Welch, 1983) is used to check the convergence of the MCMC-EM algorithm. 

The AIC, BIC, AIC3 and ICL are used for model selection. If more than 10 models are considered, slope heuristics (Djump and DDSE) can also be used. Starting values (init_method) and the number of iterations for each chain (n_iterations) play an important role to the successful operation of this algorithm. The visualize_mpln() function can be used to generate heatmaps and line plots of clusters.
